# monizze-csv

The Monizze website does not give users the option to export transactions.
This script retrieves that data from their API and saves it as a CSV file.

### Setup & usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Install python dependencies
4. Run `python monizze_csv.py --output-path <out.csv>`
   
You will be prompted to enter your Monizze authorization token. This token can be retrieved via your browser's developer tools after logging in to Monizze.
